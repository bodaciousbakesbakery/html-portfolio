 <h1>The Best Movies According to Caroline!</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Mrs. Doubtfire</h3>
 <p>This is my favorite comedy</p>
 <h3>Sound of Music</h3>
 <p>The debate rages on in my head as to whether this or Sister Act 1&2 should be my favorite musical</p>
 <h3>Hidden Figures</h3>
 <p>I learnt so much from this movie, quite sad, the way the powers that be love to hide black people's contributions!
 </p>
 <h3>The Pelican Brief</h3>
 <p>I love, love legal dramas!</p>
